    <p>Welcome to my travel blog. Here I like to talk about the different places
    I've been to and share my recommendations about each place, in case you happen
    to go there some day. I like to explore all there is to a city, but obviously,
    I can't get to everything. So this is just what I've been to and what I'm sure
    you'll enjoy. </p>
    <p>Today, I'll be talking about my favorite city: New York, New York.
      This is a guide to what I like to do around the city when I'm around. Keep in mind,
      I am a tourist, so some are more typical sights you can see while others are favorites
      by townies and foreigners alike.
      It's organized by types of activities you can do! Click the one that interests you.

      <p>New York is full of art. There are small art galleries and then there are the
        big museums that house thousands of pieces of art. My favorites are: </p>
<div class="col-1">
    <div class="col-2">
    <div id="met-museum">
      <p><span class="title-bold"><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a></span>
         is one of New York's biggest museums,
        spanning 5,000 years of art. There are a wide range of pieces from different
        countries and different times so anyone can enjoy but if you want to enjoy
        everything, plan out an entire day. Some of the notable pieces are:
      &quot;Portrait of a Young Woman&quot; by Johannes Vermeer, &quot;Self-Portrait
      with a Straw Hat&quot; by Vincent van Gogh, and &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware
      &quot; by Emanuel Leutze.

      My favorite pieces are: &quot;The Starry Night&quot; by Vincent van Gogh, &quot;The
      Persistence of Memory&quot; by Salvador Dali, and &quot;Drowning Girl&quot; by
      Roy Lichtenstein.

      <div id="central-park">
      <p><span class="title-bold">Central Park</span> may be one of New York's most famous landmarks, perhaps
      aside from Times Square. For someone seeking to enjoy nature by a walk or a jog
      or even a bike ride, be sure to check out the park. You can see from the map below
      that there are multiple entrances to this huge park. One is right by The Metropolitan Museum.
      It's always full of people so you will always be able to people watch!</p>
